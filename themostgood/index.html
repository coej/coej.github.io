                        <p class="lead">From Peter Singer, the man often described as “the most influential living
                            philosopher”, comes a new book that challenges us to start making our lives
                            really count.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>In the western world, we tend to think of ethical living as a simple&nbsp;matter
                            of being polite, obeying the law and making the odd donation to our favorite
                            charities. But with just a bit more thought, there is so much more good
                            we could do: with our donations, our careers and our lives.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>We need to start thinking&nbsp;about effectiveness: for every dollar you
                            give to a particular cause, how much does it achieve? Say you give money
                            to train guide dogs, or to the homeless shelter down the road. They may
                            well be worthy causes, but the same sums could achieve so much more if
                            used to prevent disease in the developing world.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>And it’s not just a matter of donations. Is&nbsp;volunteering to build
                            huts in Africa the best use of your time, or would it be better to go into
                            business and use the money you earn to fund a whole fleet of aid workers?&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>Inspired by the work of&nbsp;Singer and others, the Effective Altruism
                            movement has arisen to tackle these issues through research, advocacy and
                            activism. This book tells the astonishing stories of some of the key players,
                            and sets out their astonishing conclusion:&nbsp;

                            opportunity to help others with our abilities, time and money. The Most
                            Good You Can Do is an optimistic and compelling look at the positive impact

                            effective altruism movement, he provides clear guidance on what it means
